## DESCRIPTION

As a MEAN Stack Developer, you have to deploy an Angular application on Docker container on an EC2 instance.

## Background of the problem statement:

As the project is progressing, the management has asked you to deploy your Angular application on a cloud virtual machine using Docker, so that other developers can access and modify it if required.

## You must use the following:

AWS EC2 instance
Docker
Node JS
Angular CLI
GitHub

## Following requirements should be met:

Source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.
The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory in order to track your task.
The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.
